# Refactor Project

## Description

This project was a refactoring of a webpage. The motivation that drove this project was to deepen my knowledge of HTML and CSS. I did this by debugging the HTML
and CSS within the stater code that was provided.

## Installation

All you need to do to install this project is pull it off of this repository and open it in your IDE of choice.

## Usage

This webpage doesn't actually do anything. It was used to help me learn HTML and CSS. Now that I have debugged the code, it just sits there and looks pretty.
